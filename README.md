## Getting Started

### Development

To start the development servers for both the backend and frontend, run:

```bash
make dev
```

This will run `yarn workspace @bg-teach/backend dev` and `yarn workspace @bg-teach/frontend dev` in the background.

### Cleaning Generated Files

To remove generated files and directories (like `node_modules`, `.next`, and `out`), run:

```bash
make clean
```
